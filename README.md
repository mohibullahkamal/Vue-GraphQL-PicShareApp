# Vue-GraphQL-PicShareApp
In the beginning of the course, we'll cover the basic GraphQL / Apollo concepts that we need to get started, then dive into building our app. We'll build out our backend, cover creating a GraphQL server and database (hosted with MLab), and how to write resolver functions with MongoDB. Then we'll move over to the frontend, create our Vue app and connect it with our backend, develop an interface and build client-side functionality with Vue, Vuetify, and Vue Apollo / Vuex. We'll learn how to write and execute queries and mutations using Apollo to our backend to get and modify what we need. Once we cover and integrate all the essential features of our application (listed above), we'll move on to deploying our app to the web. After deployment, for those who want to stick around and make their app truly production-ready, we'll cover a number of cool features to make our app more functional, attractive and reliable.
